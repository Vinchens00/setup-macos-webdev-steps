# setup-macos-webdev-steps

These steps describe how to setup comfortable environment for web dev on MacOS.
I wrote this manual like a reminder for my own purposes mostly, when I need to setup environment from scratch, but anyway, feel free to use it / fork or ask questions if you'll have :)

## Install iTerm2
https://iterm2.com/downloads.html

## Xcode dev tools
`xcode-select â€“install`

## Install nvm

Don't forget to add required env variables to ~/.zshrc to make it available for new terminal sessions

## Install node
use LTS version as default

## Install yarn globally

## Add autocomplete to git

## Use `option + arrow left / right` in terminal for navigating
